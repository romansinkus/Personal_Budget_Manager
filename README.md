# Personal Budget Manager

## Multi-profile budget manager with custom budget sections.

The application will keep track of budgeting by allowing multiple users to input different sections of their budget
based on their spending needs and habits (which would call for multiple user profiles). Anybody looking to keep track
of their spending can use this application. Each person can cater it to their personal lifestyle by adding custom
sections to their budget (such as food, restaurant, rent, gifts, etc.). By allowing multiple profiles, this can also
enable an individual to create a different profile for different kinds of budgets, such as daily life budgeting, stocks,
business, or more.

This project interests me because I am one who tends to save money whenever possible and think that it’s important to
stay organized in terms of where money is being spent. By creating an application to keep track of my budget, it will
benefit me by allowing me to keep my budget organized and in a dynamic manner. I tend to keep track of a lot of
different things on paper such as budgeting, but when I need to make a change, then it’s not the easiest to do so.
By creating this application, it makes it easy and intuitive and alters different components of the budget. By allowing
multiple profiles, I can then also enable other people to use the application as well.

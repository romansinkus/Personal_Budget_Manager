# Personal Budget Manager

## Budget Manager with Custom Budget Sections

The application will keep track of budgeting by allowing a user to create a profile and input different sections of 
their budget based on their spending needs and habits. Anybody looking to keep track of their spending can 
use this application. Each person can cater it to their personal lifestyle by adding custom sections 
to their budget (such as food, restaurant, rent, gifts, etc.). Each of these sections of the budget that the
user creates can then be edited to alter the limit (someone decides to allocate more or less money to a certain 
section) or the balance (when the user makes a purchase, or wants to increase their balance for a certain section).

This project interests me because I tend to save money whenever possible and think that it’s important to
stay organized in terms of where money is being spent. By creating an application to keep track of my budget, it will
benefit me by allowing me to keep my budget organized and in a dynamic manner. I tend to keep track of budgeting 
on paper, but when I need to make a change, it’s often not the easiest to do so. By creating this 
application, it makes it easy and intuitive to alter different components of someone's budget. 
By allowing for customizable budget sections, it enables anyone to use the application and cater it to their own needs.
